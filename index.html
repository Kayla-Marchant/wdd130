      <p>Hi, I'm Kayla Marchant. I am from Idaho Falls and have been here at school for 4 semesters. I am studying computer programming. I love to read and try new things. My favorite types of books are nonfiction, especially the self-help books. I really like trying things I've never done before, so I've found a lot of cool, obscure things to do and experience while here in Rexburg.</p>

      <p>Idaho is best known for its potatos. In this state, residents will get to experience all four seasons while enjoying potato products all throughout the year. The summers are super hot and dry, great for farming, and the winters are bitter cold, great for snow days.</p>
