      <p>Hi, I'm Kayla Marchant. I am from Idaho Falls and have been here at school for 4 semesters. I am studying computer programming. I love to read and try new things. My favorite types of books are nonfiction, especially the self-help books. I really like trying things I've never done before, so I've found a lot of cool, obscure things to do and experience while here in Rexburg.</p>
